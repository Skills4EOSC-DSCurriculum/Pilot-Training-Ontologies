- [Course on Skills4EOSC learning platform](https://learning.skills4eosc.eu/mod/forum/view.php?id=677) (will be made available at the start of workshop)

## Training Description

In this workshop, we will learn what an ontology is and how it is used to model knowledge.
We will establish some links to its use within a data management context, and we will explore the possibilities of making queries within the semantic web using linked data.
The workshop will include hands-on exercises using SPARQL.

## Resources and Materials

All training resources will be available on the FAIR-by-Design methodology course on the learning platform. You will need to self-enrol in the course to gain access to the materials. Additional equipment and software needed to take full advantage of the training activities:

- Laptop
- Headset with microphone (online participants)
- Jupyter environment (e.g. Google colab, Binder, ESOC...)

## Certification Information (Digital Open Badges and Microcredentials)

The trainees that will pass the completion criteria for each separate stage of the FAIR-by-Design methodology will be awarded with corresponding open digital badges. All trainees that will successfully complete all activities available on the course on the learning platform will be able to obtain the higher level “FAIR Instructor” open digital badge.
