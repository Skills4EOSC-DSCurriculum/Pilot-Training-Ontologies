We will establish some links to its use within a data management context, and we will explore the possibilities of making queries within the semantic web using linked data. The workshop will include hands-on exercises using SPARQL.

If you are reusing images or text clear attribution should be provided as in the example above. Same applies in case of reusing text or other type of content. Be careful to follow the attribution rules as provided by the image source (in the example above it is Pixabay). Accessibility Using headings and subheadings, lists and alternative text for images is extremely important so as to ensure accessibility of the content for people with impairments. Also, take care to choose the appropriate color pallette for images.
